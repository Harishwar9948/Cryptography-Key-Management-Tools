#  Cryptography, Key Management & Encryption Tools

##  Overview
This project covers foundational and practical aspects of cryptography, including:
- Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption
- Hashing Algorithms (MD5, SHA-256, Bcrypt)
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- TLS/SSL Handshake Process
- Digital Certificates
- Encryption Tools (GPG, OpenSSL)

##  Practical Implementations
- GPG symmetric & asymmetric encryption
- Key generation and export
- Folder encryption
- OpenSSL key pair generation
- Hashing and file encryption with OpenSSL
- CSR creation and self-signed certificates

##  Tools Used
- **GPG** (GNU Privacy Guard)
- **OpenSSL**
- **Linux Command Line**

##  Contents
- Step-by-step commands with screenshots
- Explanations of encryption workflows
- Security notes on passphrase caching & key management

##  Disclaimer
All experiments were performed in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes only.
